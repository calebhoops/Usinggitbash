<h1>Instructions for adding a website to the internet using git bash.</h1> 
    <div>
        <h2>Creating the website</h2>
            <p>The first step in getting your website on the internets is to create it using an open source code editer. For example to makes this tutorial I am using Adobe brackets. Adobe brackets is a great choice becasue it autofills the closing tags and has a localized live preview feature.</p>

        <h2>Git Bash</h2>
            <p>What is git bash? git bash is a downdload from git that allows you to put your website online through a command line. It makes a life more simple once mastered in my opinion.</p>
            <p>Once downloaded, open git bash by right clicking on you mouse and a small menu will pop up. It shoulld be on this menu. If not then search the computer files. Downloading github might also be of some use.</p>

            <p>Once the previous step has been completed, open up git bash. The first step is to type next to the $ sign; "git init". this will start the process. </p> <img src="images/gitinit.png" height="100px" width="500px">
            <p>Next you need to checkout. To do this, type in the line under you previous line. </p>
