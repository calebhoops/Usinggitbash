<h1>Instructions for adding a website to the internet using git bash.</h1> 
    <div>
        <h2>Creating the website</h2>
            <p>The first step in getting your website on the internets is to create it using an open source code editer. For example to makes this tutorial I am using Adobe brackets. Adobe brackets is a great choice becasue it autofills the closing tags and has a localized live preview feature.</p>

        <h2>Git Bash</h2>
            <p>What is git bash? git bash is a downdload from git that allows you to put your website online through a command line. It makes a life more simple once mastered in my opinion.</p>
            <p>Once downloaded, open git bash by right clicking on you mouse and a small menu will pop up. It shoulld be on this menu. If not then search the computer files. Downloading github might also be of some use.</p>

        <h2>Now Post it!</h2>
            <p>Once the previous step has been completed, open up git bash. The first step is to type next to the $ sign; "git init". this will start the process. </p> <img src="images/gitinit.png" height="100px" width="500px">
            <p>Next you need to checkout. To do this, type in the line under you previous line. </p>

        <p>Be sure to use "git status" often to insure that you are on the right track. Git status is also useful for when you think you may have made a mistake, and want to find out.</p>
        <p>After your files are green on the page, use "git commit" to leave a note about what you did. Do this everytime you make a major change. After, do "git status" again.</p>

        <p>On the github website, setup a repository with the title of what you want.</p>
        <img src="images/gitrepo.png" height="200px" width="300px">
        <p>Once this is done, copy and paste the first line in the repository. "git push" after that and you should be just about done!</p>
